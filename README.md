## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
We need to return the element from an array that passes a function.  Both the `function` and the `array` are passed into our function `findElement(arr, func)`.

## HINTS
### Hint 1
We need to return the element from an array that passes a function.  Both the `function` and the `array` are passed into our  function `findElement(arr, func)`.  Looking through the array can be done with a `for` loop.
### Hint 2
`num` is passed to the function.  We will need to set it to the elements we want to check with the function.
### Hint 3
Do not forget, if none of the numbers in the array pass the test, it should return `undefined`.
